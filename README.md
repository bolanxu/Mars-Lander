# Mars Lander

A Mars Lander control panel that simulates a landing on Mars. 
Built using simple physics, microcontrollers, and electronics.

This is is probably one of my most complex projects and it took me about a few months to build.
My first prototype was only a microcontroller development board with and 16x2 LCD screen (see /src/lcd)
And I made it in 7th grade, only about a year after I learned how to use the microcontroller.

I finish the 2nd upgraded prototype in December of 2024. I changed the LCD display to a full panel of 4 seven-segment displays, 8 leds, buttons, and potentiometers.
The code is in the /src/panel folder.

I used an microcontroller from the 8051 family, the STC125A60S2 developed by STC Microcontrollers. Compiled using SDCC.
